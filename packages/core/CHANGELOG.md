# @threlte/core

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- cd07968: Validate click events to make sure the last pointerdown event hit the same instance as the click
  event did. This heuristic more closely resembles how the DOM works, and prevents accidental clicks
  while e.g. using OrbitControls or otherwise dragging on the canvas.

- 52e021c: # Breaking Change

  The threlte repository has been moved to its own GitHub Organization: [https://github.com/threlte/threlte](https://github.com/threlte/threlte).
  threlte consists now of two npm packages: `@threlte/core` and `@threlte/extras`, managed in a mono repository:

  `@threlte/core` consists of components, hooks and other utilites that follow three.js principles, nomenclature and inheritance as closely as useful and possible. Therefore components that have been part of the package `threlte` have been moved to the new home of all kinds of useful abstractons: `@threlte/extras`.

  `@threlte/extras` consists of useful abstractions and helpers that you may find yourself use all the time. These components do not need to follow three.js principles as strict as exports from `@threlte/core`, but they do where it makes sense.

  ## The breaking changes in detail:

  - Moved `<GLTF>` component as well as `useGltf` hook to `@threlte/extras`.
  - Moved `<Text>` component to `@threlte/extras`.

  ## How to update

  Replace imports from `threlte` and `threlte/extras`:

  1. `npm rm threlte`
  2. `npm i -D @threlte/core @threlte/extras`
  3. Replace `import {…} from 'threlte'` with `import {…} from '@threlte/core'`
  4. Replace `import {…} from 'threlte/extras'` with `import {…} from '@threlte/extras'`

  Specifically replace imports of `<GLTF>`, `useGltf` or `<Text>`:

  3. Replace `import { GLTF, useGltf, Text } from 'threlte'` with `import { GLTF, useGltf, Text } from '@threlte/extras'`

  # Other changes

  - The documentation is now hosted on Vercel and as such we are hoping for a Vercel Sponsorship for OSS. There have also been some style fixes and overhauls.
